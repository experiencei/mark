        <h1>THANKS
            TO MALVA-H</h1>
            <p style="background-color: rgb(233, 255, 220);">I
                am on medication and have been through numerous chest infections fatigue
                depression the whole works really but of late can’t seem to shake infections
                off and coughing has fractured my ribs and burst blood vessels in my eye. The
                last few weeks I have had a horrific pain in my left and right side coming
                around to my front underneath my ribs it’s so bad I scream in the night when I
                try to turn over I take morphine but doesn't help much. I lost more than half
                my lung space and was told it was irreversible we even talking about a double
                Lung transplant at my consultations, I am not on The List yet though as I am
                still fit and can do everyday tasks and my quality of life is still good. I
                make sure I walk the dog (Spud) daily and keep myself busy; I think a bit of
                cardio exercise is very good for this condition. I keep a positive outlook as
                like you say the prognosis for this disease is not good, As normal I was on the
                internet enlighten myself</p>

     <h2><span style="font-size: large;">PULMONARY &nbsp; FIBROSIS PATIENTS</span></h2>
     <P style="background-color: rgb(233, 255, 220);" >Having IPF can be lonely, isolating and scary. I have to avoid
        walking up hills or doing strenuous exercise, so I have to plan where I’m
        going, where I’m going to park, especially if I have to do a lot of talking in
        meetings etc. But when people share their stories of coping with IPF or
        substance use disorder, it can provide inspiration and hope and be a welcome
        reminder that you are not alone in your challenges. I had suffered from IPF as
        long as 2 and half years, I had no idea what was happening and didn’t know
        where to turn for help. It was hard then because I didn’t understand the
        symptoms earlier. When you struggle with a disease, many won’t believe you.
        Early detection of PF and early treatment could have prevent full-blown IPF and
        improve the long-term prognosis. There was a time I decided to get away from
        everyone, moving into a serene house in the woods with a pond and vocal
        wildlife. I said, “I loved to gaze at the moon and listen to an orchestra of
        fireflies and bullfrogs”.&nbsp; As do most
        families, I went through many sleepless nights and periods of intense grief. I
        cannot express the pain and anguish that came over me.&nbsp; We (my wife and I) fought for proper medical
        care and humane treatment. We did everything we could and we did it with love,
        with intelligence, with experience that threatens my life. We have ALL given pieces
        of ourselves, sacrificed our own way of life for this disease and have spent
        many late nights worrying and praying. Behind the closed doors of our homes or
        a therapist’s office or a specialist office we put our heads together to decide
        what is best for me and sometimes most of our choices work but more often we
        are less than successful. There was very little support from friends, family
        and the community. I racked my brain and kept thinking of all the things I
        could have done differently to prevent such a horrible illness.  They<br>
    <br>
    It was such a relief when someone told me about the Pulmonary
Fibrosis Foundation of Australia. There I found other people going through very
similar situations as me. I have dealt with shock, sadness, guilt, grief, anger
and fear to name a few. I was able to interact with our new counselor, he told
me about MALVA-H treatment and their depot office in Australia. I finally found
some respite and help. Even though, our specialist was not in support.&nbsp; Don’t expect everyone to understand your
journey, especially if they have never had to walk your path. I am not
judgmental of other people- I see good in everyone.&nbsp; We have been using this herbal supplement for
just a month and 2 weeks with up-to-the-minute development, the symptoms are all
gone. I stay calm now. I can go to anywhere i wish. This illness has helped me
grow to be a better person. Once again I have found balance in my life.
<br>
<br>
I would be very happy to receive any comments on what I have
written here. It is also important to hear other points of view on the subject.
I will keep you all updated after I complete the whole treatment in the next 3
months.
